            Lukashenko on Tuesday described his view of the negotiations that led to Prigozhin ending his march towards Moscow, <br>
            and said the oligarch is now in Belarus per the deal.<br>

            “The most dangerous thing, as I understand it, is not what the situation was, but how it could develop and its consequences,”<br>
             Lukashenko said, according to Belarussian state media.<br>

            “I also realized there was a harsh decision taken - to destroy. I suggested Putin not to hurry. Let’s talk with Prigozhin, <br>
            with his commanders.” Lukashenko – a longtime ally of the Russian President – said Putin told him: “Listen, Alex, it’s useless.<br>
             (Prigozhin) doesn’t even pick up the phone, he doesn’t want to talk to anyone.”<br>
